## Hi, I’m Denys — AI enthusiast & optimist

**AI Caver** is my research playground. I don’t track model leaderboards — I observe **how AI changes people**: daily routines, decisions, incentives, work, care, and play.  
This site is a **field notebook**: experiments, failures with lessons, small tools that stick, and essays about behavior shifts under the pressure of automation.

### What you’ll find here
- **Research.** I continuously collect data about AI adoption and practices, and analyze how work models and human behavior change.  
- **AI-Diary.** A running log of how AI reshapes **my own life** — strong enough to be worth documenting.  
- **Field notes** — practical write-ups from real use (what worked, what didn’t, why).  
- **Experiments** — tiny projects to test assumptions.  
- **Playbooks** — repeatable workflows for busy humans.  
- **Essays** — how AI nudges individual choices and collective behavior.

### Principles
- **Optimism with guardrails.** Believe in progress, measure risks.  
- **Hands-on over hype.** Tools that ship beat slides that shine.  
- **Clarity and agency.** Humans stay in control.  
- **Privacy by default.** Minimal data, local when possible.  
- **Document the path.** Share context, not just results.
